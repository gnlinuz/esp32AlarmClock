Esp32 Internet Alarm Clock with temperature and hummidity reading.
Using Esp32 microcontroller as the heart of this project along with 
DHT22 as temperature and hummidity sensor.

This is smart internet alarm clock connecting to the internet 
using ntp servers for synchronizing the date and time.
You can set the Alarm by setting the "start" and "end" day
and the time for the alarm to go "ON". If the alarm is set, and 
the power goes out, when power is restored the clock will self adjust
date and time and restore any alarm settings that was previously set!

Using 2 OLED 64x128 dots, one for date and time and the other 
for temperature and hummidity readings using the DHT22 sensor.
Display current, MIN and MAX readings.
